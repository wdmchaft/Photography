Whether you are a newbie, wanting to learn the basics, or a dad whoâ€™s disappointed with the vacation photos, this app is a great place to begin.  Overall, you will learn things at a fairly slow pace, so you can absorb concepts.  However, if at any time, you feel the need to reread some text, or look at a caption, please do, as some things might become harder later.  Also having a usable DSLR is important, so as to practice your recently learned material."];

You probably also have something that says auto, a flower, mountains etc.  This is called the Mode Dial.  It us used to change what mode your camera will shoot in.  Lets talk about the M, S, A, and P modes. \n\nM: Manual.  Use this to control both shutter speed and aperture.\nS: Shutter priority.  Change the shutter speed, and the camera will adjust the aperture to have to have good light balance.\nA: Aperture priority.  Change the Aperture, and the camera will adjust shutter speed for best light balance.\nP: Program.  Get partial control over both shutter speed and aperture.\nNote: This will make much more sense later on, when you will learn about aperture, shutter speed, and light balance."];
